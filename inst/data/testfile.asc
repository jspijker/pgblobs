This is sample of a textfile with a longer description of the blob. To
prevent that we have to fill this file with nonsens we provide some nice
words from Bob Ross:

Imagination is the key to painting. Working it up and down, back and
forth. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Only God can make a tree
- but you can paint one. At home you have unlimited time. Here's
  something that's fun.

Take your time. Speed will come later. Didn't you know you had that
much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let's go up
in here, and start having some fun You got your heavy coat out yet?
It's getting colder. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they
are very important.

You need the dark in order to show the light. Nothing wrong with
washing your brush. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. It's life. It's
interesting. It's fun.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate
brown. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Don't be afraid to
make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make
themselves. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

This is truly an almighty mountain. Any little thing can be your
friend if you let it be. See. We take the corner of the brush and let
it play back-and-forth.

I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Just relax and let it flow. That
easy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you
practice you can do.
